"""Normalize overlapping/seaming SVG paths into one clean, font-safe outline.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The font generator merges every <path> of an icon into a single glyph outline
filled with the nonzero winding rule. In a browser (and in docs/icon_catalog.svg)
each <path> is painted independently, so overlapping black layers and touching
seams are invisible. But once merged into one glyph, overlapping contours with
opposing winding cancel to unintended white holes, and touching sub-paths leave
hairline seams. The generator's winding normalization only copes with fully
*nested* holes, not partial overlaps, so those icons render corrupted in the OTF.

This tool resolves each icon's geometry the way Google's picosvg/nanoemoji do:
it `simplify`s every path (honouring its own fill-rule) and boolean-UNIONs them
into a single non-overlapping, consistently-wound path whose filled area is
byte-for-byte what the catalog/browser shows. That single clean path is the
safest possible input for the font: no overlaps, no seams, no winding conflicts.

INTENDED KNOCKOUTS ARE PRESERVED
--------------------------------
Some icons deliberately knock a white shape out of a solid body (e.g. the "W" in
document_word, the bullets in document_bullet_list, the alef in book_open_alef).
That white cut only exists in the font, via winding cancellation, and the catalog
actually hides it. Unioning would fill it in. Such icons are detected (a whole
path sitting inside another) and SKIPPED, leaving them untouched.

USAGE
-----
  python3 tool/normalize_svg_overlaps.py                 # normalize all sources
  python3 tool/normalize_svg_overlaps.py a.svg b.svg     # normalize specific files
  python3 tool/normalize_svg_overlaps.py --check          # report, change nothing
                                                          # (exit 1 if any file
                                                          #  needs normalization)

Requires: skia-pathops, fonttools  (pip install skia-pathops fonttools)
This is a preparation step, like tool/prepare_svg_sources.dart. It is idempotent:
re-running on an already-normalized file produces no change. Always review the
result visually and keep sources under version control while running it.
