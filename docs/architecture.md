# Architecture

## Sources of truth

The system has three separate concerns:

- `assets_src/svg/`: vector geometry;
- `icon_manifest.yaml`: stable icon identity, API metadata, codepoint,
  provenance, licensing, and upstream state;
- `tool/config.yaml`: package and generator paths, names, canvas, and starting
  codepoint.

Generated files are outputs, never sources.

## Manifest guarantees

`schema_version` protects against silently interpreting an incompatible format.
Each icon has an immutable opaque `id`, stable public `name`, stable codepoint,
source path, size/variant, directionality/deprecation state, upstream tracking,
and licensing provenance.

Codepoints live in Unicode's Private Use Area (`0xE000–0xF8FF`). The current
generator API requires contiguous allocation, so deletion and reuse are
forbidden. Aliases must preserve the original glyph and constant.

## Font generation

`tool/generate.dart` calls `svgToOtf` programmatically. It constructs an ordered
map from manifest codepoint order and verifies the returned glyph metadata
against every manifest record. The OTF timestamp is fixed so identical inputs
produce byte-identical output.

`icon_font_generator` is pinned exactly to 4.1.0 because ordering, naming, and
font bytes are build-system behavior. Upgrading it requires repeating the
generator and codepoint proof of concept.

As its final step, `generate.dart` runs `tool/repair_glyphs.py`, which rewrites
each non-knockout glyph outline directly from its source SVG (24×24 mapped onto
the em, y-flipped, no re-fitting). The pinned generator's outline converter
distorts a few complex glyphs — a horizontal shift on
`book_open_large_search_24_filled`, contour damage on `stander` and
`search_in_the_text` — even from clean, correctly wound sources; this step makes
the font geometry byte-for-byte what the sources and `docs/icon_catalog.svg`
show. It is deterministic, preserves the fixed head timestamp and all generator
metadata, and leaves the three intended interior knockouts untouched. It
therefore requires Python 3 with `skia-pathops` and `fonttools`.

## Public API

`lib/otzaria_icons.dart` exports only generated icon constants. Gallery catalogs
and all-icon maps stay outside production library code to preserve tree-shaking.
Handwritten future helpers belong outside `lib/src/generated/`.

Each constant is compile-time `IconData` containing codepoint, font family, and
font package. The package intentionally has no runtime dependency on Fluent UI
System Icons.

## Determinism

`dart run tool/generate.dart --check` repeats the pipeline in an isolated
temporary copy and compares validated SVG sources plus every generated artifact.
CI uses this read-only mode. A clean check proves contributors committed the
output corresponding to current SVG, manifest, config, and generator code.
